# Senior-Project
Pathfinder, maze solving visualizer, my senior project


Just a fun toy to play with, 
add a start and end point, draw a maze, choose a pathfinding algorithm and then run
you can also make the delay between searches longer if you really wanna watch it move
load up some pre-made maps if you don't wanna draw 
currently there is no easy way to save a maze you draw, instructions to do so below:
  open the HTML
  inspect > open console
  refresh page to fix grid sizing
  draw the maze you wish to save
  right click on console to clear log 
  type: console.log(grid)
  right click on console to save
  save as a .txt in appropriate mazes folder
